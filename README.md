# Aircraft Scheduling

Simple scheduler of flights for aircraft traffic.

Intention is to help the user schedule for an aircraft's day considering the flights that are available on the 24 hours of that day.

Flight scheduling can be done through card clicking to which the application will answer for it being a valid or invalid addition to the schedule.
